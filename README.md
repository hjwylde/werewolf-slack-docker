### Game description

Long has the woods been home to wild creatures, both kind and cruel.
Most have faces and are known to the inhabitants of Foug√®res in Brittany, France; but no-one from
    the village has yet to lay eyes on the merciless Werewolf.

Each night Werewolves attack the village and devour the innocent.
For centuries no-one knew how to fight this scourge, however recently a theory has taken ahold that
    mayhaps the Werewolves walk among the Villagers themselves...

Objective of the Game:  
For the Loners: complete their own objective.  
For the Villagers: lynch all of the Werewolves.  
For the Werewolves: devour all of the Villagers.
